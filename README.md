# College Database SQL Project
This project showcases SQL skills through a simple college database containing students, courses, and enrollments. The goal is to answer common academic queries using SQL concepts such as joins, subqueries, set operations, grouping, and views.

## 📁 Project Overview
The project includes:

1. Designing 3 relational tables: students, courses, and enrollments
2. Populating tables with sample data (15–20 entries)
3. Writing SQL queries to solve 15 real-world academic questions
4. Creating a view to calculate student GPAs



## ✅ Key SQL Concepts Covered:

1.	Joins (INNER JOIN)
2.	Aggregation (COUNT, AVG, ROUND)
3.	Grouping (GROUP BY, HAVING)
4.	Subqueries
5.	Set operations (NOT IN, intersection logic)
6.	Views
7.	CASE statements (GPA conversion)


## ❓ Sample Questions Answered

1.	List all students majoring in 'Computer Sci'
2.	Find all courses with more than 3 credits
3.	Show students and their enrolled courses
4.	List student grades for 'Intro to CS'
5.	Count students per major
6.	Average age of Computer Sci majors
7.	Number of students per course
8.	Most popular course
9.	List courses with no enrollments
10.	Students with highest number of courses
11.	Courses with no students
12.	Students enrolled in all 'Computer Sci' courses
13.	Students not enrolled in any course
14.	Students enrolled in both 'Intro to CS' and 'Data Structures'
15.	Create a view showing student name, major, and GPA

## 🧪 Sample Data
Each table contains a small dataset (10–15 records), making it easy to test and understand query outputs.
